## About me

Hi ! My name is Adrien Gaillard--Lafargue, I am french IT student and an aspiring pentester.

I've been into programation since highschool, at the beginning it was just to create games and some other graphicals projects using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). After graduating from high school, I enrolled at **Epitech**, where I am currently in my third year. That's where I was able to develop my passion for IT through various projects, using numerous languages and technologies.

During my curriculum I came across some cybersecurity projects and I loved it. I learned a lot of new things and I wanted to go further and get better at this so I began to do challenges and machines on plateform like [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org/).

Since then, my ambition is to make cybersecurity my profession.

## This website

This website is a way for me to show what I've learned and the skills I have developed until now as a cybersecurity enjoyer through some online challenges that I have completed.

It will be updated frequently, as I am always trying to complete differents challenges and try to learn more about different categories.
