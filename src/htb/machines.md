# HTB Machines Completed

## Concept

On HackTheBox, the machines are VM that were created with some vulnerabilities on purpose. The concept is simple, from the initial IP adress of the machine, and sometimes with initial credentials, we have to gain more privileges until we become administrator. This are typicals boot2root challenges.

## HTB Rules

The writeups of some machines I've done are not available for you. This is because it is forbidden to publish writeups of actives HackTheBox machines.

Thank you for your comprehension !
